The PDF for this random variable gives the probability of a man having a height between two values, say a and b. The PDF is often denoted by f(x), where x is the value of the random variable.\n",

    "Some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model include:\n",

The standard deviation determines the width of the bell curve: a larger standard deviation leads to a wider bell curve, while a smaller standard deviation leads to a narrower bell curve. The mean determines the position of the peak of the bell curve: if the mean is larger, the peak will be shifted to the right, while if the mean is smaller, the peak will be shifted to the left.\n",
